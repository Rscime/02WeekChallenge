            <p>I Graduated from UCF with a bachelors in Biology and Biomedical Sciences with a minor in Psychology. After graduating from UCF I continued my educational career at FAU and completed a masters degree in Geosciences with certificates in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Remote Sensing. While completing my masters degree I taught Biology at West Orange High School. After completion of my Masters degree I started looking for a job in my field and I started working as a GIS Technician at Applied Ecology Inc. an environmental consulting firm based in Melbourne, FL. While working as a GIS techician I have noticed some gaps in the user experience of ESRI tools and hope to one day work with ERSI to make these spatial analyst tools more efficent.</p>
